Documentation for the Atlas of Lie Groups project

This branch contains Sphinx-generated html files. The source .rst files are stored in the master branch of this repo. We are using the free service github provided for project websites. By storing html files in a branch named gh-pages, we trigure github to build and publish a website that is named after the repository the branch is in (for more detail please see https://help.github.com/en/github/working-with-github-pages/about-github-pages#publishing-sources-for-github-pages-sites). 


Under normal circumstances, the files in this branch shouldn't be changed manually.
