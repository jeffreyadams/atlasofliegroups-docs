# atlas Documentation Project
The gh-pages branch stores the html files used to produce the webiste https://jeffreyadams.github.io/atlasofliegroups-docs/

All the html files here are generated by Sphinx.

## Sphinx

Sphinx is a tool that makes it easy to create beautiful documentation. For more information see http://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/stable/index.html

It automatically generated webpages using .rst source files. Sphinx also supports inline math or display math.

**Install Sphinx**

Sphinx supports all three major operating systems. For details of how to install Sphinx on your machine, see http://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/stable/install.html

## How to use this repository

To only clone this branch, do:
```
git clone -b gh-pages --single-branch https://github.com/cuiran/atlas_documentation.git
```	
You can view the website locally by opening the index.html file with your browser.

### To contribute

All the source files are the .rst files under the master branch. After modifying the .rst files, in the same directory do
```
make html
```
This will generate html files in atlas_build/html. Replace the old files with the newly generated ones (keep the readme.md and license.md), then push to gh-pages branch:
```
git push origin gh-pages
```
The changes will show on https://jeffreyadams.github.io/atlasofliegroups-docs/
