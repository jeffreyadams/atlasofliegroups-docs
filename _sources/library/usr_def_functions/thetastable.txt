=====================================

Some functions related to theta-stable parabolics. The basic functions
are in parabolics.at and induction.at.

Main functions:

1) :math:`A_q(\lambda)`  construction:

Note: theta_induce_irreducible(pi_L,G) has infinitesimal character
infinitesimal character(pi_L)+rho(u)

Aq(x,lambda,lambda_q) is defined as follows:
if lambda_q is weakly dominant set q=q(x,lambda_q),
apply derived functor to the one dimensional lambda-rho(u) of L.

REQUIRE: lambda-rho(u)\in X^*.

Aq(x,lambda,lambda_q) has infinitesimal character lambda+rho_L,
thus the one-dimensional lambda has infinitesimal character lambda+rho_L
for L, and goes to a representation with
infinitesimal character lambda+rho_L for G; i.e.
Aq takes infinitesimal character gamma_L to SAME infinitesimal character
for G. For example, in equal rank, with x on the compact Cartan,
Aq(x,rho(G),rho(G)) is a discrete series with infinitesimal character rho(G).

If lambda_q is not weakly dominant, define
Aq(x,lambda,lambda_q)=Aq(wx,w\lambda,w\lambda_q),
where w\lambda_q is weakly dominant.

2)  Good/Fair conditions:

i.)  Condition on the roots of :math:`\mathfrak u` :

For theta_induce(pi_L,G),
gamma_L -> gamma_G=gamma_L+rho_u. Then:

GOOD:  <gamma_L+rho_u,alpha^vee> > 0;

WEAKLY GOOD:  <gamma_L+rho_u,alpha^vee> \ge 0;

FAIR: <gamma_L-rho_L+rho_u,alpha^vee> > 0.

ii.) For  Aq(x,lambda,lambda_q): gamma_L=lambda+rho_L;

gamma_L -> gamma_G=gamma_L = lambda+rho_L

Aq(x,lambda)=theta_induce(x,lambda-rho_u)

GOOD: <lambda+rho_L,alpha^vee> > 0;

FAIR: <lambda,alpha^vee> > 0;

WEAKLY FAIR: <lambda,alpha^vee> \ge 0.

theta_induce(pi_L,G) = Euler-Poincare characteristic of the
cohomological induction functor.

fair => vanishing outside middle degree => honest representation

weakly fair: same implication

NB: <gamma_L-rho_L_rho_U,alpha^vee> >= 0 does NOT imply vanishing
(in general) if pi_L is not one dimensional,
hence "weakly fair" is only defined if pi_L is one dimensional.
