=====================================

Also see parabolics.at;
see "Parabolic Subgroups and Induction", in dropbox, ultimately on atlas web site.

Fix a subset S of the simple roots, defining the complex standard
parabolic P_S (see parabolics.at) of type S. We define a set KGP(S) (a
quotient of KGB) such that (roughly) KGP(S) <-> K\G/P_S.

More precisely, for any x\in KGB and p(\xi)=x,
KGP(S) is canonically in bijection with K_\xi\G/P_S; i.e.,
K_\xi conjugacy classes of parabolics of type S.

K orbits on G/P_S, equivalently K-conjugacy classes of parabolics of type S:
Given a RealForm and a subset S of the simple roots,
S -> partial order on KGB, generated by ascents in S
-> equivalence relation generated by this
KGB/equivalence <-> K\G/P_S
Define KGP to be KGB modulo this equivalence.

Data: ([int],KGBElt)=(S,x) where S lists the indices of a subset of the
simple roots of root_datum(x)
Equivalence: (S,x)=(S',y) if these correspond to the same K orbit on G/P_S,
which means:
real_form(x)=real_form(y), S=S'  (i.e. same complex parabolic), and
x=y in the equivalence defined by S.
In particular, given (S,x), taking x itself for the strong real form,
(S,x) goes to the K_x-conjugacy class of the standard parabolic P_S.

Given (S,x),
write [x_1,...,x_n] for the S-equivalence class of x\subset KGB.

The last element x_n is maximal, and is uniquely determined.
This orbit of K on G/P_S is closed <=> x_1 is closed in KGB.
