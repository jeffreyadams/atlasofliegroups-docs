parabolics.at
=====================================

Topics addresses in this script:
complex parabolics and Levi factors;
parabolics with :math:`\theta` -stable Levi factor;
:math:`\theta` -stable parabolics;
real parabolics.

See kgp.at: the data types KGPElt and Parabolic are synonyms; both consist
of a pair (S,x) where S is a list of integers representing a subset of
the simple roots, and x is a KGB element. This gives a K-conjugacy class
of (complex) parabolics of type S
