The `Atlas of Lie Groups and Representations`_ is a project to make available information about representations of reductive Lie groups over real and p-adic fields. Of particular importance is the problem of the unitary dual: classifying all of the irreducible `unitary representations`_ of a given reductive Lie group.

The Atlas consists in part of a project to determine the unitary dual, by mathematical and computational methods. The open-source software developed for this project now provides information about the structure and representation theory of general real reductive Lie groups. It is designed to be a tool for learning the subject, for testing conjectures, for constructing examples; that is, for doing mathematics.

.. We are also planning to make information about Lie groups and representation theory, in particular unitary representations, available to the general mathematical public.
