About the Software
===================

There are two programs installed by the instructions in
:ref:`download_and_install`. The underlying software
library is called ``Fokko`` in honor of its primary architect Fokko du Cloux.
Fokko worked on the software in 2004 and 2005.
Since then Marc van Leeuwen is the primary software developer.

The program ``atlas`` is designed for interactive exploration of real
reductive Lie groups and their representations. It has been developed
by Marc van Leeuwen since 2006. It is built on a programming language
``axis``, also developed by Marc van Leeuwen. The atlas software
invokes (invisibly to the user!) the libraries of ``Fokko`` to create
mathematical objects; then the ``axis`` language offers standard
programming tools (loops, variables, scripts, and so on) with which
the user can manipulate them.

An important part of ``atlas`` is the
(constantly growing) library of predefined scripts, which can be used
or modified to do interesting mathematical tasks.
These files are found in the ``atlas-scripts`` directory, and have the
suffix ``.at`` (or occasionally ``.ax``). 
This library has
been developed by Marc van Leeuwen, Jeffrey Adams, Annegret Paul, David Vogan
and others.
