Principal Series of Split Groups
=================================

So far the focus has been on Cartan subgroups, whose information is
encoded on the element ``x`` as the Cartan involution of the complex
abstract group $H$, which determines the real group $H(\mathbb
R)$. Now ``x`` is really a &K&-orbit on $G/B$. So, it is the support
of the corresponding D-module. In order to explain this in detail we
will look at some easy cases. In particular we will be talking about
the principal series of split groups.
