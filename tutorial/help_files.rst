Help files
===========


``atlas.help``
--------------


To know more about the different data types you can quit ``atlas`` for a moment and\
 go to the directory atlas-scripts and look for the helpfile atlas.help. This file \
gives an introduction of the software and how to install it. If you go to #3. Desig\
n principles of ``axis`` language, and current limitations, scrolling down you will\
 find information about the details covered in the present document including the l\
ist of data types used by the software. Some of them are ``bool`` for boolean, ``in\
t`` for integer, ``rat`` for tational, etc.; and some are related to Lie groups, li\
ke LieType, RootDAtum, etc. that we will see later in this notes.


``atlas.functions.help``
-----------------------


This is another useful help file that lists all the functions defined on ``atlas``.\
 It describes their domain and range (data types); starting from the basic symbol o\
perators ``+``, ``_``, ``*``, to booleans, to word operators like ``null`` that tak\
es an integer ``n`` to the null n-vector, to ``invert`` and ``diagonalize``, which \
act on matrices, etc.


``scripts.help``
-----------------


Finally, this help file lists most of the supplementary scripts found in this direc\
tory and a short description of what they do. The most basic one is ``basic.at`` wh\
ich includes many useful scripts. We will see how to load them and look at them dir\
ectly to see what they do.
