Example :math:`Sp(4,R)`
=======================

Let us find all the :math:`K\backslash G/B` elements of
:math:`Sp(2,\mathbb R)`. 


There are a couple of commands that will
give you discrete series::

   atlas> whattype discrete_series ?
   Overloaded instances of 'discrete_series'
     (KGBElt,ratvec)->Param
     (RealForm,ratvec)->Param
   atlas>
   atlas>
   atlas> whattype all_discrete_series_gamma ?
   No overloads for 'all_discrete_series_gamma'
   atlas>

NEED TO PUT HERE A DISCUSSION ON THE COMMAND ``all_discrete_series_gamma``
THAT WILL LIST THE FOUR D.S FOR SP4R.

This command lists all discrete series with the same parameters. The only things that is different is the element ``x``.
