:math:`K` orbits on :math:`G/B`
================================
In order to explain how ``atlas`` uses the ``KGB`` we need to discuss the theory a little bit.

Recall that a parameter is a triple :math:`p=(x,\lambda, \nu)`

where :math:`x \in K\G//B`

:math:`lambda \in(X^* +\rho )/(1-{\theta }_x)X^*

:math:\nu \in {X}_{\mathbb Q} ^* /(1+{\theta }_x ) X_{\mathbb Q}^*
\cong (X_{\mathbb Q} ^*)^{-\theta _x}`

In fact it is in    +rho

So we often see nu as being in the quotient or in the space n the
right hand side.

So the infinitesimal character can be written as

:math:`\gamma =\frac{1+\theta _x}{2}\lambda + frac{1-\theta _x
}{2}\nu`
