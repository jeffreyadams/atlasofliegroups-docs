:math:`K` orbits on :math:`G/B`
--------------------------------

In order to understand KGB we need to

Recall that a parameter is a triple :math:`p=(x,\lambda, \nu)`

where :math:`x \in K\G//B`

:math:`lambda \in(X^* +\rho )/(1-{\theta }_x)X^*

:math:\nu \in {X}_{\mathbb Q} ^* /1+{\theta }_x ) X_{\mathbb Q}^*
\cong (X_{\mathbb Q} ^*)^{-\theta _x}`

In fact it is in    +rho 

So we often see nu as being in the quotient or in the space n the
right hand side.

So the infinitesimal character can be written as 

:math:`\gamma =\frac{1+\theta _x}{2}\lambda + frac{1-\theta _x }{2}\nu`



Since we are taking n fixed by -theta
Previusly we saw that \theta 

acting by -1 crrespnds t mas split 

If rho not in X^* then need to go to a cover


so the expression is well defined 

and
