# Todo List

## Short term
* Add information about what the software does
* Transfer example page from http://www.liegroups.org/software/examples/
* Decide the font/style of "atlas".
* Test git subtree push from atlas_build/html to gh-pages.
* put command completion examples in atlas library.
* Expand the page with examples instead of clustering the page.
* the plus or minus signs next to the table of contents should stay
* fix videos page. The inline videos are not appearing. Because the directory paths in raw html.
